# flappy bird

i wanted to learn sdl, and i've made some projects in c (its my most comfortable language)

so i thought it'd be fun to make flappy bird

# how to run

1. have sdl installed

2. on unix based systems excecute compile.sh

3. excecute flappy bird excecutable

# about the project

this was originally intended to be a mandelbrot set project but then i remembered, complex numbers are difficult to program.

a challenge i imposed on myself was to make this as modular and as small as possible, (NOT EXCECUTABLE SIZE, LINE SIZE if i wanted to i'd use more gotos)
i think its fine making flappy bird, albeit a very basic and repetetive task that i've completed before
